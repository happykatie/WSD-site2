				<h2 id="about">Farm Fresh Fun</h2>
	
				<p>Farms dot Florida's landscape, creating a green quilt of rural authenticity. Our agricultural tourism offers bountiful opportunities to glimpse country life, indulge in honest-to-goodness farm freshness and shake hands with our farming culture.</p>
				<p>Our state is rich in glorious scenery and a hearty farming environment. Taste varietals and fruits of our winemakers. Indulge in farm-raised meats and produce. Pick your own sweet citrus and berries. Farmers markets are a tradition, brimming with fresh fruits, vegetables, flowers and crafts. Participate in a fall festival with corn mazes, pumpkins, and hayrides. Explore a farmstead on your horse or wagon ride.</p>
